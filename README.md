# Chess-assignment
I have written this program in kotlin to solve the chess assignment.
Currently, the program is able to calculate the moves of the pawn, king, and queen.

To run the program, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew run --args="<Piece> <Position>"
   example: ./gradlew run --args="Pawn D4"
```

To run the test cases, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew clean test
```
